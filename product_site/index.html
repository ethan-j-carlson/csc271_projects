        <h2>About this page</h2>
        <p>
            <strong><a href="index.html">Quick Phonetics</a></strong>
            is a website which makes researching phonetics easier. It provides
            a quick reference to all of the<br> symbols in the <em>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">
                International Phonetic Alphabet
            </a> </em> (IPA), and all of the language-neutral information about
            the symbol and its associated<br> sound that one needs to pronounce
            the sound, or to implement it in an application's backend.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Study the IPA?</h2>
        <p>
            Researching or describing the pronunciation of a language can often
            be difficult due to the challenge of describing one language's <br>
            sounds in the perspective of the other, non-inclusive language.
            The IPA remedies this by providing a standard intermediate between<br>
            languages. Being able to transcribe a language in IPA and be able to
            read it greatly simplifies the ability to convey and teach the sounds
            <br>of a language. Many languages will have some source transcribing
            their words with IPA, or otherwise log which IPA sounds the langauge
            <br>has and what each letter can represent. Thus, knowing the IPA
            is a very valuable skill in studying language.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Should Studying Language Become Easier?</h2>
        <p>
            Our world is becoming increasingly globalized. Many people move to
            countries that do not share their native language, either for fun<br>
            or for business. Because of this, the number of people who want or need
            to improve their pronunciation of a foreign language is only going up.
            <br>Additionally, apps such as <em>Duolingo</em> have been popularizing
            studying language for fun or for a sense of accomplishment.
