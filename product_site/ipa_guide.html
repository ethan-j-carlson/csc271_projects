        <h2 id="place_of_articulation">Place of Articulation</h2>
        <p>
            Consonants are determined primarily by two things: the <em>place of
            articulation</em> and <em>manner of articulation</em><br><br>
            The place of articulation is where friction is made in the vocal
            tract for a given sound. Usually, this is determined by the<br>
            tongue, and where it makes contact to the rest of the mouth.
            However, there are places of articulation that act independently<br>
            of the tongue.<br><br>
            There are four major categories that the places of articulation
            are grouped into based on their phonetic similarities and<br>
            their location. These categories usually have one or more sounds
            that overlap between two categories:

                    This category includes dental, alveolar, palatoalveolar,
                    retroflex and alveolopalatal consonants.<br>
                    This category includes a subcategory called postalveolar
                    consonants, which are made directly behind the<br>
                    alveolar ridge, and includes retroflex, palatoalveolar and
                    alveolopalatal.

                    alveolopalatal, palatal, velar and uvular sounds.

                    Layngeal consonants are made either with the larynx
                    (a.k.a the voicebox), or around it. This includes<br>
                    pharyngeal, epiglottal and glottal consonants. Many also 
                    put uvular sounds in this category.

        <p>
            There are also common sounds which use the lips alongside
            a dorsal place of articulation. These include labio-velar<br>
            sounds that use the soft palate/velum and the lips, and
            labio-palatal sounds that use the hard palate and lips<br>
            Below is a table goind into details about each place of
            articulation, including examples of sounds in a major language.<br>
            They are put in order of how close they are to the front of the
            mouth.

        <h2 id="manner_of_articulation">Manner of Articulation</h2>
        <p>
            Manner of articulation is the other primary factor determining
            how consonants are made. This is often determined by how close<br>
            an articulator (usually the tongue) to the place of articulation.
            However, there are other more complicated parts that go into <br>
            articulation, which will be discussed.<br>
            For consonants, there are 4 primary groups of articulations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Stops</em> are made by blocking air from exiting the mouth
                completely, building up pressure and then releasing.<br>
                The most simple category of stops are called <em>plosives</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Fricatives</em> are made by touching the tongue to the
                place of articulation, but weakly enough to let air pass.<br>
                This usually results in a hissy or breathy sound.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Trills</em> are made by bringing the tip of the tongue to
                the place of articulation and relaxing it, allowing breath<br>
                to make the tongue vibrate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Approximants</em> are made by bringing the tongue close to
                the place of articulation without touching it. These sounds<br>
                are close to vowels due to the similarly lower friction.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Stops and fricatives are in a superclass called obstruents, where
            the sound is formed by significantly blocking airflow<br>
            Within these categories, there are subtypes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Nasals</em> are a variety of stops that allow air to flow
                through the nose but not the mouth.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Implosives</em> are a variety of stops where the glottis
                moves down as air is blown out, partially trapping air as<br>
                it is being blown out.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Ejectives</em> are a variety of stops where the glottis
                is constricted, blocking airflow. Air is instead pushed ou
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Clicks</em> are a type of obstruent that is close to a stop.
                Air is trapped between a dorsal point of articulation and<br>
                a different place infront of it, starting at the hard palate.
                Clicks can vary by both points of articulation.

                Taps/flaps are sounds where the tongue only briefly touches
                the place of articulation. Taps and flaps are often typed<br>
                together, but they are distinct by how the tongue moves to and
                from the place of articulation. To me, taps act more like a<br>
                short stop, and flaps act more like a single flap of a trill.

                <em>Affricates</em> are sounds that start as a plosive and ends
                as a fricative. Airflow is stopped, pressure is built, but<br>
                the air is let out gradually as a fricative.

            <li>
                <em>Lateral fricatives</em> are fricatives where the airflow is 
                split in two, having air go through either side of the<br>
                tongue, but being blocked through the center. This is usually
                done by putting the sides of the back of the tongue against<br>
                the molars while articulating a fricative.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Lateral affricates</em> are the same as normal affricates,
                but the stop is released as a lateral fricative.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Lateral approximants</em> are approximants where the
                airflow is split in two like a lateral fricative, but while<br>
                an approximant is being made instead of a fricative.

            Nearly every place of articulation has a stricture series, where
            the articulator is gradually lowered to produce different<br>
            sounds.

        <h2 id="phonation">Voicing and Phonation</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a fun question: what's the difference between P and B?
            They have the same place and manner of articulation, but they<br>
            are definitely for different sounds in English. The answer is
            voicing.<br><br>
            Voicing is done by vibrating the vocal cords. /p/ is voiceless,
            where the vocal chords don't vibrate. /b/ is voiced, where the<br>
            vocal cords do vibrate as the sound is made. You can confirm This
            by feeling your throat as you make /p/ and /b/<br><br>
            Voicing is one of many phonations. Another is called aspiration.
            Aspiration is adding extra breath to a consonant. In English,<br>
            voiceless plosives are aspirated at the beginning of words, and
            not aspirated at the end. It may be hard for English speakers<br>
            to hear the difference, but putting your hand close to your mouth
            as you say "pop" lets you feel the difference between the two.<br>
            Heavily voiced sounds are never aspirated, but one can make breathy
            voiced sounds, where an aspirated sound is partially voiced.<br>
            This is because both airflow and voicing is determined by the
            glottis, the opening between the two vocal cords. Voicing needs<br>
            the vibration of the two vocal cords, while aspiration needs them
            to be open and relaxed. Breathy voicing is essentially a<br>
            compromise between the two. English does not distinguish between
            them, but they can be made by trying to whisper a voiced sound<br>
            such as /b/. On the IPA consonant chart, voiced consonants are put
            to the right of a voiceless consonants.<br><br>
            A vocal fry, formally called creaky voicing, is another form of
            voicing where the vocal cords are compressed more. The<br>
            stereotypical "surfer dude" voice is notable for its use of
            creaky voicing.<br><br>
            Tone is another major type of phonation, that many languages use
            to distinguish sounds, usually vowels. Sounds are distinguished<br>
            in tone by changing the pitch of the sound, either gradually,
            or in quick steps. English uses a gradual tone when questions<br>
            are being asked, specifically the rising tone.<
        </p>

        <h2 id="vowel_height">Vowel Height</h2>
        <p>
            When the tongue goes lower than the point of being an approximant,
            sounds enter "vowel space". Tongue <em>height</em> is one of three
            primary<br>factors which determine what vowel is made.<br><br>
            /i/, as in b<strong>ee</strong>, lies at the top of vowel space,
            while /a/ or /ɑ/ as in f<strong>a</strong>ther, lies at the<br>
            bottom. Between the heights of /i/ and /a/ lie sounds such as /ɛ/
            like is b<strong>e</strong>t.
        </p>

        <h2 id="vowel_depth">Vowel Depth</h2>
        <p>
            The <em>depth</em> of a vowel is the second primary factor in
            making a vowel. /i/ as in b<strong>ee</strong> and /u/ as in 
            y<strong>ou</strong><br>
            are roughly at the same height, but are very different vowels.
            They differ in rounding, but also differ drastically in depth<br>
            /i/ is a front vowel, and /u/ is a back vowel. There are also
            central vowels, with /ə/ as in <strong>uh</strong> being the<br>
            most common one found in English. Furthermore, there are sounds
            that go between these 3 depths. /ɪ/ as in <strong>i</strong>t<br>
            is near-front, between front and center. /ʊ/ as in c<stong>ou</stong>ld
            is near-back, between center and back.<br><br>
            Above I have described the convention in which the IPA describes
            all vowels, where they are in a 2D space, often represented by<br>
            a vowel trapezoid. However, this is not completely representative
            of how they are truly made. For better details see
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Articulation">this</a>
            <br>
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Front,_raised_and_retracted">
                this.
            </a>
        </p>

        <h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>
        <p>
            As briefly mentioned in the section on vowel depth, vowels also
            differ in <em>rounding</em>. Rounded vowels have the lips more<br>
            closed, while unrounded vowels have the lips more open. /i/ and /u/
            are very unrounded and very unrounded respectively, and thus<br>
            make for good examples in rounding. Every vowel can be rounded or
            unrounded. Many languages have vowel pairs only made distinct<br>
            by their roundedness. French is an example of this, having /i/ as
            in par<strong>i</strong>s, and /y/ as in t<strong>u</strong>.

        <h2 id="suprasegmentals">Suprasegmentals</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Suprasegmentals</em> are used to distinguish how sounds 
            transition from one to the other.<br><br>
            The tie bar is a suprasegmental used primarily to represent
            affricates, such as /t͡ʃ/ as in <strong>ch</strong>air. They are<br>
            also used in biarticulated sounds, where two, non interfering
            consonants are made at the same time<br><br>
            There are many other, primarily determining stress, sound length
            and pauses, which are documented on other pages from this site.
        </p>
        <h2 id="diacritics">Diacritics</h2>
        <p>
            All that was said above is most of what is needed to distinguish
            between the "letters" of the IPA. However, some of what was<br>
            discussed above needs <em>diacritics</em>, also known as accent 
            marks. Generalized English needs little to no diacritics to<br>
            transcribe, but they are regardless an important facet of the IPA.
            Many languages have sounds, such as nasal vowels, that can<br>
            only be represented with diacritcs. Other diacritics are often
            used to be more precise in transcribing specific sounds in a<br>
            language that does not otherwise care about the distinction.
            Because they are a complicated subject, they will be omitted<br>
            here, and they can instead be found elsewhere on the site.
