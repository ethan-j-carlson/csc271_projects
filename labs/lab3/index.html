        <h1>Burritos</h1>
        <img src="images/209610.png" alt="Stylized burrito">
        <p>
            Burritos are my favorite food largely due to their convenience
            and their versatility. Many things can be put into a burrito,<br>
            and the most common inclusions (rice, beans, chicken, etc.) are
            affordable while being quite delicious. One of the best dishes <br>
            that my mom makes is a burrito, and I remember always being happy
            when she made them.

            You can put anything in a burrito, but below are the things I most
            prefer to put in mine, inside of a corn tortilla:
